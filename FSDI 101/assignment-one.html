    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        I'm from <i>Santa Ana, California</i>, and I grew up in <b>Phoenix, Arizona</b>. I joined the <sup>US Army</sup> in <mark>2014</mark> and got out in <mark>2017</mark>. I was medically discharged due to injuries to my <b>back and hips</b>. My original plan for after the Army was to try and join a <i>law enforcement</i> agency like the US Marshalls or something like that. Due to my injuries I was unable to pursue that path, <i><b>and that's alright</b></i>.

        What I've been working up to since my <strong>separation from the military</strong>, is acquiring as many skills as possible to put together, <i>and open</i>, a custom vehicle fab/repair shop. What has happened so far is that I've completed a combination welding program from a trade school in Arizona, and upon graduation from that school I began working in the metal trades; more specifically, in the pipe trades as a pipefitter/welder. In late <mark>2019</mark> I went back to the <i>same</i>trade school and completed the diesel heavy truck program they offer, which has helped expand my knowledge about <b>both</b> gasoline and diesel engine technologies. I feel that course has been an <i>immense</i> help to get me closer to the ultimate goal.

        My latest job change has me working for <i>Mr. Elon Musk</i> building <b>nosecones</b> for the Starship project. I started with SpaceX as a <b>TIG</b> welder in November of <mark>2020</mark> during the <b><i>covid</i></b> pandemic. Two short months later I became a lead with my own team. My job made me realize that I'm <b>not going to be able to work in <i>this</i> field forever</b>. Maybe as a hobby, but not at the normally required workpace of a place like SpaceX.

        I rarely go on Snapchat, but for some reason I did, <i>once</i>, maybe <b>two weeks ago</b>. I saw a buddy of mine had posted a story of a schoolwork project he was working on. He had built a <b>welcome</b> page for a website with elements I had never given a second thought to until that moment. I asked him about it and he said it was web development, and that he was coding. I didn't give it much thought in the moment, but later on, I had an itch that <b>needed</b> to be scratched. So I typed "coding app" into the search bar on the play store, and from there I fell down the rabbit hole. This is the career path I <i>want</i> to take in order to allow me enough income and time for other things needed to set up my shop. And so, <i>we're off</i>.
